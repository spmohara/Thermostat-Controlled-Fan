Designed and created a system capable of controlling a 12 volt fan by programming an ATmega328 microcontroller to trigger a relay on/off when a desired temperature level was reached. The temperature was determined using an LM34 transistor and was then displayed on a 2x16 Back-lit LCD screen. Ideal applications of this project are seen in control systems for household fans and computer cooling systems.
