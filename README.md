Designed and created a system to control a 12 volt fan by programming an Arduino microcontroller to trigger a relay on/off when a desired temperature level was reached. The temperature was determined using an LM34 temperature sensor, which was then shown on a LCD display. Applications of this project are seen in modern household HVAC systems and computer cooling systems.
